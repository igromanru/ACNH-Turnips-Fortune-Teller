# ACNH Turnips Fortune Teller
Turnips Fortune Teller is a small tool for New Horizons, that reads out Turnips prices from a save game made with [JKSV](https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSV).  
This tool was made for legit players who don't want to use cheats or save editors, but still want to know the Turnips prices for the coming week. (Not all have the time to check every morning and evening their prices)

### How to use
1. Double click the `ACNH Turnips Fortune Teller.exe`
2. Press the `Open save game...` button and select/open the `main.dat` or `mainHeader.dat` from your save backup. Both files should be in the same location.
3. Done.
